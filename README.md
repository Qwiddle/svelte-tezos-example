# svelte-tezos-example

An example SvelteKit app that uses the [`svelte-tezos`](https://github.com/Qwiddle/svelte-tezos) library to interact with the Tezos blockchain. Feel free to clone and modify this project as needed. More examples and more advanced features are planned and will be coming _soon_.

Now follow the instructions below to open a hot-reloadable dev server or to build and bundle your app for production.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
